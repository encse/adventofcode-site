A little but unexpectedly we are given a geometry problem here, where we
actually need to calculate with floating point numbers. I don't remember
any problem when this was needed in Advent of Code. 

Part 1 asks us to find the intesection of two 2 dimensional lines, which
is simple enough, but .Net doesn't have a built in matrix library, 
so I had to inline everything that was needed.

Part 2 was much more interesting. We need to find a position and velocity
of a _stone_ that meets all particles provided in the input. The particles
move in a 3D line now.

I solved this first using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but I didn't like it
becasue it was totally independent of Part 1. So went looking around in
others' solutions until I found a good one that uses coordinate transform.

The idea is that we try to guess the speed of our stone in a loop, then supposing
that it is the right velocity we create a new reference frame that moves with 
that speed. Note that the stone doesn't move in this frame. We transform each 
particle into this reference frame as well.

Since the stone is not moving if we properly guessed the speed, we will find 
that each particle meets the stone's line at the same point. This is the place
where the stone is in this reference frame.

We can reuse code from Part 1, just need to project everything to the XY
plane first and compute the stone's `(x,y)` position, then do the same in the XZ
or YZ plane to get `z` as well.
