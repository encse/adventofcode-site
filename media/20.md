I modeled Part 1 closly following the description. I didn't want to introduce separate
classes for the gate types, insted I used a function parameter that tells what
happens when a gate receives a signal. I have one constructor function for each
gate type (nand, repeater and flipflop) and these can add the necessary state and
capture it in the returned lambda. I'm just doing this because it's ðŸŽ„.

For Part 2 I layed out the graph using graphviz which immediately shows that
that `broadcaster` feeds four different subgraphs. These work in isolation and 
a Nand gate connects their output into the `rx` node. Furher investigation shows
that subgraph runs in an endless loop that has prime length. So we just need
to measure these and multiply them together to solve the second half of the problem.
