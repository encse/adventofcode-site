I modeled Part 1 closely following the description. I didn't want to introduce separate
classes for the gate types, instead I used a function parameter that map signals to signals.
I tells what should be emitted when a signal is received. I know that this is like Elf logic, 
but it's ðŸŽ„, what did you expect? I have one constructor function for each
gate type (Nand, FlipFlop and Repeater) these declare the necessary state variables
and capture it in the returned lambda. Everything is self contained, I have a single Gate type, 
yet different behavior.

For Part 2 I layed out the graph using graphviz just to see what's going on. 
This immediately showed that `broadcaster` feeds four different subgraphs. 
These work in isolation and a Nand gate connects their output into `rx`. Further 
investigation shows that each subgraph runs in an endless loop that has prime 
length (at least for  my input). We just need to measure these and multiply 
them together to solve the second half of the problem.
