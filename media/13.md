A mirror was hidden in some rectangular board. Some of the 'rocks' in the picture we got were just reflections. The problem didn't specify if the mirror was put horizontal or vertical. But we knew that it's accross the board from one end to the other and it is not necessarly in the middle.

Pretty much following the description, I created a function that tries all possible placements and computes how many errors (smudges - using the problem's terminology) were if the mirror was placed right there. Then just selected the one that had zero errors.

The second half of the problem asked for the very same thing but this time there was one 'smudge' in the reflected image.
