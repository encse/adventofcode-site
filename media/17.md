I keep pushing back on OOP, but wanted to encapuslate what's common about the crucibles.
Finally came up with an inventive 'Rules' type that has three functions telling if a crucible
needs to move forward, can be turned or stopped. 

Part 1 and Part 2 differs only in the rules for the small and ultra crucibles. I would
probably use an interface with two implementations under normal cicrumstances, but this 
is AoC and I started to think like an Elf.

The algorithmic part is a pretty standard graph search implemented with a priority queue.
If you saw one, you have seen it all. We are starting from the top left corner with the 
only 'goal' state in the bottom right. Since we are minimizing for heatloss, we can use 
just that as the priority of the queue items.
