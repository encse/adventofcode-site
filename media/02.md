Ok, now we are on track. The hardest part of this problem is the parsing, but I introduced a helper that can extract a number in the context of a regular expression which works like a breeze. And later even realized that I only need to keep track of the maximum of the red, green and blue boxes, so my `Game` struct became just four integers.

The actual 'algorithm' for part 1 and part 2 is very simple, and linq makes it quite readable as well.
