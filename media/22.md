We deserved a simple one today. I created a function that applies gravity to the blocks,
first. It orders them in ascending Z order then just runs over the list and pushes each
block down as much as possible. The result is a nicely packed jenga tower.

Several `records` were introduced to make things easier. I have a `Range` and 
a `Block` with some helpers like `IntersectsXY` that tells if the X-Y projection of 
two blocks intersects or not.

I also created a function that returns the _support structure_ of our model at hand, 
so that I can tell the upper and lower neighbours of each block easily.

The eye catching _Kaboom_ function does the heavy lifting. It goes over the input and
selects each block for desintegration. It calculates the number of blocks that start 
falling when this single block is desintegrated. The result is a list of integers.

Both parts can be quickly implemented with this.
