This has been a really enjoyable challenge involving 4 dimension hypercubes. 
Looking at Part 1, I expected something totally different, because it's just an 'implementation'
challenge, where you need to model some virtual machine following certain rules.

It goes without saying, I jumped on that and implemented it that way while sipping my morning coffee. But this is Day 19 and there _has to be a twist_ at some point. We got a totally different challenge for the second half. It's like opening your calendar and finding two chocolates instead of one. Yay!

Part 2 looks frightening first, but not for a seasoned Advent of Coder with
multiple dimension travels behind its back. It's asking for the volume of a hypercube. Don't believe? Think about it. We start from a 4000x4000x4000x4000
sube and slice it up to smaller parts based on the conditions we are given.

At the bottom of the process we still have some 4 dimensional ranges and it's
either Accepted or fully Rejected.

We just need to follow the instructions precisely and Part 2 is tamed.

Now we can even reuse it to implement Part 1, so we can get rid of the interpreter
that we created earlier. In Part 1, we just start from small 1x1x1x1 cubes and
check if they are accepted or not.

The code is the longest I've written this year so far, but it's hopefully readable
after this introduction.
