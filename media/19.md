Part 1 is an _implementation_ challenge, where you need to model some virtual machine following certain rules. I jumped on that and wrote it while sipping my morning coffee. But this is Day 19 and there _has to be a twist_. We got a totally different challenge for the second half. It's like opening your calendar and finding two chocolates instead of one. Yay!

Part 2 looks frightening first, but not for a seasoned Advent of Coder with
multiple dimension travels behind its back. It's asking for the volume of a hypercube. Don't believe? Think about it. We start from a 4000 x 4000 x 4000 x 4000
cube and slice it up to smaller parts based on the conditions we are given. At the bottom of the process we get to some smallish cubes which are either _Accepted_ or fully _Rejected_.

Just follow the instructions precisely and Part 2 is tamed. To clean things up a
bit, we can even reuse this to implement Part 1. (So much about our nice interpreter from the morning.) Go over the list of parts as they were tiny 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 cubes and check if they are accepted or not.

The code is the longest I've written so far, but it's hopefully readable
after this introduction.
