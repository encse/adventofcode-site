This was an easy problem that could be solved with brute forcing, but I went the 
maths path and implemented a quadratic equation solver instead. 

It's easy to compute how far our boat moves if we wait for `x` ms at the beginning. 
The solution to this equation tells us the `x`-es for which we break the record distance.

Part 2 is just Part 1 with bigger numbers.
