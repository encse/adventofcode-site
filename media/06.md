This was an easy problem that could be solved with brute forcing, but I went the 
maths path and implemented a second degree equation solver as well. It's easy to 
compute how far our boat will move if we wait `x` ms at the beginning. The solutino
of this equation tells us the x-es for which we break the record distance.

Part 2 is just Part 1 with bigger numbers.
