The wait is over, let's get started, our elves need us! There was no problem with part 1 it's just some regular expression, but wait a minute, huhh... what is this in part 2?

It was not immediately obvious what 'oneight' should mean and usually such weird cases are mentioned in the example input. Not this time! Is it '1' or '18'? Depending on how one interpreted the problem statement he could have spent a quite a lot of time on figuring this out. 

I think this was a little bit of an oversight for day 1.
