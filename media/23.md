Today's problem looked frightening first, because it's asking for the _longest_
path between two nodes. Shortest path is easy to do with _Dijkstra_ or whatever _graph 
search_, but I don't know about an efficient way to calculate the longest one. I have
a feeling that it is somehow related to the _Hamiltonian path_ which is NP-complete, 
so there might not even exists a super efficient algorithm to solve today's problem in 
the general case.

But this is a puzzle, and there needs to be a way to solve it. I decided
to convert the problem from map traversal to graph traversal first. I created
_nodes_ from the _crossroads_ of the map (those tiles that connect 3 or more 
`"."` cells). Also assigned a node to entry and one to the exit.
 
Two nodes become _connected_ if there is a _road_ between them. This means that
they are reachable following the _path_ of the map without visiting other
crossroads in between.

This reduced the problem quite a bit. In my case it went down to about 30 nodes 
and 120 edges for Part 2. Part 1 is even smaller with 60 edges or so.

This graph is small enough to solve it using _dynamic programming_ with a _cache_.
Since we have just 30+ nodes, I represented them as _powers of 2_ and a set of
these became a _bitset_ stored in a _long_.
