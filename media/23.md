Today's problem looked frightening first, because it's asking for the _longest_
path between two nodes. Shortest path is easy to do with Dijkstra or whatever graph 
search, but I don't know an efficient way to calculate the longest one. I have
a feeling that it is somehow related to the Hamiltonian path which is also NP complete, 
so there might not even exists a super efficient way to solve today's problem in 
the general case.

But this is a puzzle, and there needs to be a way to solve it. I decided
to convert the problem from map traversal to graph traversal first. I created
nodes from the _crossroads_ of the map, i.e. those tiles that connect 3 or more 
`"."` cells . I also created two nodes for the entry and the exit.
 
Two _nodes_ become connected if there is a _road_ between them. This means that
they are reachable following the _path_ of the map without visiting other
crossroads in between.

This reduced the problem quite a bit. In my case to about 30 nodes and 120 edges
for Part 2. Part 1 is even smaller with 60 edges or so.

This graph is small enough to solve it using dynamic programming with a _cache_.
Since we have just 30+ nodes, I represented them as _powers of 2_ and a set of
these became a _bitset_ stored in a _long_.
