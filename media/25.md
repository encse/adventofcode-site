This is our last day, it's historically not very hard, also there is only Part 1.

The puzzle is asking us to cut an undirected graph into two components by 
removing three edges. Time to open the literature. Soon enough I found [Karger's 
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger%27s_algorithm) on Wikipedia.

It's a randomized algorithm that we can apply to our graph. It find _some cut_
which is not necessarily minimal, but there is a good chance that it finds the
minimal one in a few tries. This is the _Elf_ way!

Karger is not hard to implement, but I'm not used to doing this thing anymore, so
I spend quite a lot of time on it until I get it right, but at the end I could 
also extend it to return not only the size of the cut, but also the sizes of the 
two components it generates. Part 1 asks for the product of these sizes.

I just let Karger's do it's thing in a loop and it really finds a cut with 3
edges in a few milliseconds.
