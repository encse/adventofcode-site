An other day! In Part 1 we need to determine how many 'winning' numbers we have 
in a scratch card, this is simple enough. 

Part 2 can be treated in a very-very bad way if somebody doesn't notice that it's
nothing else but a loop!. We start with the first card #1 and see how many 
card we are winning, this will generate some new cards of id 2, 3 and so. Then move 
to card #2 and continue this process until the end of the list. Return 
the number of all cards we dealt with.
