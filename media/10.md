In Part 1 we had to find the length of a loop that was defined by a funky ASCII 
art pipe network that even used J, and F characters for the turns.

Part 2 asked to compute the area of the loop, I implemented ray casting 
for this one. There are lots of other ways to solve this, a similar problem 
and different algorithm can be found in Day 18.
