In Part 1 we had to find the length of a loop that was defined by a funky ASCII 
art pipe network that even used J, and F characters for the turns.

Part 2 asked to compute the area of the loop, which is implemented using 
ray casting as you can read in the program text below. There are lots of
other ways to solve this, a similar problem and different algorithm can
be found in Day 18.
