A day of memoized functions / dynamic programming. In each line of the input has some a pattern (string) and constraints (numbers). Going over the pattern we need to figure out what should be put in the place of the ? symbols so that it satisfies the constraints on the right. How many ways are to satisfy all conditions?

This shouts for a recursive approach, the details are in the program text below.

In Part 2 the input is transformed to something bigger with a process
called 'unfolding', otherwise it's the same as before.
It's sole purpose is to force us adding memoization to the algorithm we came up with.
